## Admin Dashboard

The admin dashboard is a separate interface accessible at:

```
/#/admin
```

It is intentionally **not linked in the main navigation** for security. Access it by:

1. **Typing `/#/admin` in the browser address bar**, or
2. **Clicking the "Staff Portal" link** at the very bottom of the website footer (subtle, small text)

### Admin Features

| Tab | What It Does |
|-----|-------------|
| **Dashboard** | Overview metrics — product count, active discounts, revenue, low/out-of-stock alerts |
| **Discounts** | Create, edit, and stop discounts (see below) |
| **Stock** | View and edit stock levels inline. Bulk actions: add, subtract, or set stock for filtered results or ALL products at once |
| **Orders** | View recent orders with customer info and status |
| **Analytics** | Detailed inventory value breakdown by category |

### Working with Drafts, Save, Undo & Redo

The admin uses a **draft system** — all your edits (stock and discounts) are staged as a *draft* and do **not** affect the live store until you explicitly save.

- **Save Changes** — A button in the top bar (highlighted when you have unsaved edits). A confirmation popup appears before publishing to the live store.
- **Undo / Redo** — Arrow buttons in the top bar step backward/forward through your unsaved edits.
- **Unsaved indicator** — An "Unsaved changes" badge shows when your draft differs from the live data.
- **Exit protection** — If you try to leave with unsaved changes, you'll be asked to confirm before discarding.

### Discount Management

In the **Discounts** tab you can:

1. **Create a discount** targeting:
   - **All** products
   - A specific **Category**
   - **Individually picked products** (searchable, multi-select list with thumbnails)
2. Set the **percentage** (presets 5–50% or custom) and a **duration** (start & end dates).
3. **Review all current discounts** — each shows whether it's *Active* or *Scheduled/Ended*, how many products it affects, and its date range.
4. For any existing discount you can:
   - **Update the percentage**
   - **Extend the end date**
   - **Stop (remove) the discount** (with confirmation)

When a discount is active, its price is automatically applied across the store, and a `-X%` badge appears on affected product cards.

> **Confirmation popups** appear before adding/stopping discounts and before bulk stock updates and saving — so nothing changes by accident.

> **Note:** All saved data persists in `localStorage`. To reset to defaults, clear your browser's local storage for the site.
